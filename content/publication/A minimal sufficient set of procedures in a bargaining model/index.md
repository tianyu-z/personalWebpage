abstract: For a two-player bargaining model, Mao (2016) extends the alternating offers procedure of Rubinstein (1982) to more general procedures and explores which payoff outcomes are feasible, in the sense that they can be supported by some procedures as subgame perfect equilibria. In this paper, we define a special class of procedures called normalized procedures. We show that while the set of normalized procedures can yield all feasible partitions, none of its proper subsets can do so.
