Developed based on [LOLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04326) and [MCTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04931), the goal is to find a mechanism for the so that the agents can converge to a cooperate-cooperate equilibrium in game such as the coin game or prisoner's dilemma game. We aim to find a scalable solution.
