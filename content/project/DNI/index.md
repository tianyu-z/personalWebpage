We follow [Decoupled Neural Interfaces](https://www.deepmind.com/publications/decoupled-neural-interfaces-using-synthetic-gradients) and [Learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474) and aim to design a better way to decouple blocks to unlock forward and backward lockings.
